This repository is complementary to the talk given to the [Edmonton R Users Group on 2022-04-28](https://www.meetup.com/edmonton-r-user-group-yegrug/events/284835558/).

## Resources

* [{echarts4r} website](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/index.html)
* [{echarts4r} GitHub repository](https://github.com/JohnCoene/echarts4r)
* [Apache ECharts website](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html)

## Apache ECharts <img src="https://echarts.apache.org/en/images/logo.png" align="right" height="100"/>

**Apache ECharts** is an open source JavaScript data visualization library, with [a bunch of built in types of visuals to choose from](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/index.html).

The [cheat sheet](https://echarts.apache.org/en/cheat-sheet.html) can be a great landing place to dig into the specific theming elements for your chart that you have access to manipulate via the *hundreds* of formatting arguments offered.

You can even [edit a chart on the fly in the browser](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=heatmap-cartesian) to watch the chart change as you manipulate the JavaScript code directly.

### The {echarts4r} R package

* Developed and maintained by [John Coene](https://github.com/JohnCoene)
* First stable release hit CRAN in 2018 (v0.0.2)
* Most recent version is v0.4.3

### The Case for {echarts4r}

* Interactivity that you can't get from {ggplot2}
* Syntax that is as simple as {dplyr}
* Aesthetics that are *cleaner* and *smoother* than [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) (e.g., no big toolbar above the chart with widgets that no one ever uses...)

### Standout Capabilities

Some of my other favorite things about {echarts4r} include:

* [sliders for *"zooming"* the x- and/or y-axis](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/brush.html#sliders)
* capturing client-side events, allowing you to:
  + capture mouseover, click, or brush (selection) events
    + [Example](http://shiny.john-coene.com/echarts4rShiny/)
  + connect two charts, so that you can filter one chart by interacting with another chart (similar experience to [{crosstalk}](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/))
    + [Example](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/articles/brush.html#brush)

## Reproducibility 

If you would like to reproduce these charts yourself, we recommend taking advantage of the [{renv} package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to ensure the package versions you are using are consistent with this repository / talk. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Open the [echarts4r-intro.Rproj](echarts4r-intro.Rproj) file from the directory on your local machine where you cloned this repository. This should install the {renv} package if you do not already have it installed, but if you donâ€™t see that happen in the console, run `install.packages("renv")`.

3. Run `renv::restore()` to install the [dependencies](renv.lock) needed to run this app successfully

4. Run the scripts in the [examples](examples/) directory

## Session Info

```{r}
utils::sessionInfo()
```
